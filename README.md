<h3>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h3> </br>
This is a simple implementation of the classic tic-tac-toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a practice project that I found on YouTube and recreated.

<h3>Installation</h3>  </br>
To use the Tic-Tac-Toe game, simply download the files and open them with a code editor like Visual Studio Code.

<h3>Usage</h3>  </br>
    Open the index.html file in your web browser.
    Start playing by clicking on the cells to make your moves.
    The game will automatically switch between X and O turns.
    The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
    If all cells are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
